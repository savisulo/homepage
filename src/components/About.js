        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <div className="about-text">
          <p>
              I graduated as a chemist back in 2017 and have since been working mainly in the area of education,
              first in Otava Publishing Company as a publishing editor of upper secondary school chemistry learning materials,
              and after that as a developer of digital chemistry learning materials in MAFY Oy.

              My journey into web development began in the summer of 2022, when I fully discovered my love for coding.
              I first attended to some online courses (Front End Web Development track in teamtreehouse.com and MOOC
              in University of Helsinki) and then I applied to an intense training of modern web development
              lasting for 6 months (ending in March 2023). I am very happy and proud of
              myself for making this career change in my life, this really is The Thing for me!
              But I'm not going to totally forget about my previous life involved in chemistry, since chemistry and coding
              goes really well together as well, so it would be great to combine those two in the future.

              One of my greatest strengths as a developer is my ability to persist and never give up when faced with a challenge.
              I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills, which has helped me make rapid progress in my coding journey.
              I also have a knack for memorizing complex concepts and quickly applying them in real-world situations.
              While I may be a bit introverted, I also enjoy being part of a community and working with a diverse range of people.
              I am kind and always willing to help out my colleagues when needed. My personality can best be described as calm,
              thorough, pondering and detail-oriented, which has proven to be a valuable asset when it comes to writing clean
              and efficient code.

              When I'm not exploring new coding frameworks and libraries or tinkering with my own personal projects, I enjoy
              reading good books, watching drama and psychological thrillers, jogging, and practicing reformer Pilates.
